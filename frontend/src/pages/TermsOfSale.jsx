          corresponding to the start of your paid subscription. In some cases,

          in a given month. Access our website and click on the &quot;View

          other reason, and you do not change your Payment Method or terminate

          the Payment Method issuer may charge you a foreign exchange or other
          fee. Please contact the issuer of your Payment Method for more
          information. <br /> <br />

          series. To cancel your subscription, go to the &quot;Your
          Account&quot; page and follow the instructions. If you cancel your
          subscription, your account will be automatically closed at the end of
          your current billing period. To find out when your account will be
          closed, click on &quot;View billing details&quot; on the &quot;Your

          wish to terminate your Origins Digital subscription at some point,
          including during your free trial period, you may need to do so with
          that third party, for example by viewing your account with that third
          party and disabling auto-renewal or unsubscribing from the Origins
          Digital service through that third party. You may also consult the
          billing information attached to your Origins Digital subscription by

          associated features and functionality, in accordance with all
          applicable laws, rules and regulations, or restrictions on the use of

          license, create derivative works from, sell or use (except as
          expressly permitted in these Terms of Use) any content or information

          4.5: The viewing quality of streamed films and TV series may vary from
          computer or device to computer or device and may be affected by a
          number of factors including your location, available bandwidth and the
          speed of your internet connection. To achieve SD quality, your system
          should have a minimum connection speed of 0.5Mbps. However, we
          recommend a faster connection to improve the quality of the video. The
          availability of HD and Ultra HD depends on your internet connection
          and the capabilities of the device. Not all content is available in HD
          or Ultra HD and not all subscription types allow for the reception of
          HD or Ultra HD content. A download speed of at least 5Mbps per stream
          is recommended for viewing HD content, which is defined as 720p or
          higher. A download speed of at least 25 Mbps per stream is recommended
          for viewing Ultra HD content, which is defined as a resolution greater
          than 1080p. You are responsible for the cost of your Internet
          connection. Please contact your Internet Service Provider to find out
          about any charges for Internet data usage. The time it takes to watch
          a movie or TV series varies depending on several factors, including
          your location, the bandwidth available at the time you watch the
          title, movie or TV series you have chosen and the configuration of
          your Origins Digital enabled device. <br /> <br />
          4.6: Origins Digital's streaming software is designed by or for
          Origins Digital and allows for the streaming of Origins Digital
          content through Origins Digital compatible devices. This software may
          vary depending on the device and media used; functionality may also
          vary depending on the device. By using our service, you acknowledge
          that it may require the use of third party software subject to the
          licensing terms of such third parties. You agree to automatically
          receive updated versions of the software from Origins Digital or third
          party software associated with the service. If your Origins Digital
          enabled device is sold, lost or stolen, please deactivate it. If you
          do not log out of Origins Digital on the device or deactivate the
          device, future users will be able to access the Origins Digital

          account. To deactivate a device, follow the corresponding instructions
          on the &quot;Your Account&quot; page.

          Digital account. In order to maintain control of the account and to
          prevent anyone else from accessing the account (and accessing the
          account history information), the Account Holder must not disclose to
          anyone their password or the details of the Payment Method associated

          information in response to these communications may lead to identity
          theft. Always access your confidential information directly through
          the Origins Digital website, not by following a hyperlink in an e-mail
          or other electronic communication, even if the e-mail appears to be
          official. We may terminate or suspend your account to protect you,
          Origins Digital or its partners from identity theft or other
          fraudulent activity.
